		<h2>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</h2>
		 <p>
		 	Structured content frames its content as packages made up of small bits of data that have a defined relation to each other rather than just presenting a block of text. Semantic HTML is a markup text that communicates the relationship between different document elements.

			Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?
		</h2>

		 <h4>Denise Jacobs argues that we all have a troll-like inner critic. Of the methods she identifies to banish this troll, which would be most successful for you? Why?</h4>
		</div>
		  <p>
			One method Jacobs suggests to banish the inner critic is to aim for "good" instead of "perfect". I personally also think this works best for me because I am unfortunately a perfectionist and I have to constantly remind myself that whatever I get done, nothing can ever be done perfectly and there will always be flaws.

		 <h4>In David McRaney's article, what is "hyperbolic discounting"? List one method McRaney identifies to counteract hyperbolic discounting. Which would work best for you?</h4>
		</div>
		  <p>
			According to David McRaney's article, the tendency to get more rational when you are forced to wait is called hyperbolic discounting. Furthermore, McRaney states that one way to counter hyperbolic discounting is through what is known as "precommitment", which is essentially setting mini deadlines instead of one big final one. For me, that exact method helps me stay on top of my workload the best because it keeps me accountable and prevents any procrastination from taking place.

		 <h4>Critical Web Design addresses four types of power in networks. As you learn web publishing fundamentals, what network-making power do you (or don't you) have as the creator and publisher of your work?</h4>
		</div>
		  <p>
			As a creator in Internet Studio, I have network-making power over what content I choose include on my webpage. These choices change the experience and the ability of the audience to connect with my work. However, my power is still limited as I do not get to control external factors such as where in the search engines my work show up in.
