	<h1>KATSEYE</h1>
	<p>KATSEYE, otherwise known as 캣츠아이, is a 6 member group that was formed based off of the survival show and Netflix documentary "Dream Academy". They debuted on June 28, 2024, with the single “Debut” from their first EP, SIS (Soft is Strong)</p>

	<p> I really like KATSEYE because of the story behind them. Survival shows are a huge variety program within K-POP culture, which is how KATSEYE came to be. They brought girls from different ethnicities and races for one goal of debuting. They are inclusive to so many different races/ethnicities, and seeing that kind of diversity within one group is really cool. I also really love their songs and discography!</p>
