        <h2>How can framing your project in a story format help you refine your ideas?</h2>
        <p>
          BBy framing projects in a story format, we can refine ideas by thinking through the experience from a more personal perspective rather than viewing it as just a list of things to do. When we imagine a user as the main character and think of what can motivate them, what challenges they could encounter while on the website, or any unnecessary complexities, it can greatly help refine the projects. This clarifies the purpose behind each task on whether the experience flows easily. In this way, storytelling acts as a filter that keeps ideas aligned to the user experience.

          <h2>What are different ways to establish hierarchy (or emphasis) in typography design?</h2>
          <p>
            We can establish hierarchy in typography by creating a clear contrast between different texts in a way that guides the reader's eye to what matters the most. Designers can do this by varying size, changing the weight of text, applying different colours, and adjusting the placement of the text positions.
