		<h2>Things I learned from the lesson</h2>
		<ol>
			<il>I learned that with HTML tags, there is usually<br> always an opening and closing tag,<br> <br>in which the closing tag will almost always have a "/" at the end.</il>
			<il>Another thing I learned is that<br> there are 6 different types of headings<br> and the order of headers ranges from <br>"h1" being the biggest, and "h6" being the smallest <br>in terms of hierarchy.</il>
			<il>Last thing that I learned is that<br> if an image fails to load on a web page,<br> a user can mouse over the area originally<br> intended for the image and read a brief description<br> of the image through the "alternative" attribute. </il>
