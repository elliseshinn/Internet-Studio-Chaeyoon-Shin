	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>

		<h2>Things I learned from the lesson</h2>
		<p>1. I learned that with HTML tags, there is usually always an opening and closing tag, in which the closing tag will almost always have a "/" at the end.</p>
		<p>2. Another thing I learned is that there are 6 different types of headings and the order of headers ranges from "h1" being the biggest, and "h6" being the smallest in terms of hierarchy.</p>
		<p>3. Last thing that I learned is that if an image fails to load on a web page, a user can mouse over the area originally intended for the image and read a brief description of the image through the "alternative" attribute.</p>

		<h2>Semester Project Idea</h2>
		<p>My idea for the Semester Project is to create a website catered towards college freshmen who does not know what to expect. There would be sections including what they need for dormitories, types of study habits and resources they can use, etc. Another possible section I was thinking of was an advice section where sophomores and upperclassmen could help out incoming freshmen, but this section would require extra security with ID verification (or email verification to ensure they're all still an undergraduate student). </p>
