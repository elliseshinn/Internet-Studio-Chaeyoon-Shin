	<p>Barbie is a character created by Ruth Handler, manufactured by American toy and entertainment company Mattel and introduced on March 9, 1959. She is featured in many variations of series of shows and movies, most notably Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse as well as other movies like Barbie: Fairy Secret. Barbie is known to be a caring and compassionate doll, with many jobs and is very qualified. Barbie's the eldest of four daughters, with her three younger sisters being Skipper, Stacie and Chelsea. For the most part, Barbie has a close relationship with all three of her sisters! She is also often talked about along with her counterpart doll Ken, who in the show is also her boyfriend.</p>

  <p>Barbie's Youngest Sister</p>
<p> In one of the episodes, Chelsea runs for Mayor. Barbie is very supportive of her in this episode and Chelsea, although unrealistic, gives very planned out ideas and her policies for if she is elected as mayor. In her showings and speeches, she gained a lot of cheers and hype, however, lost. But I believe she would be a good running mate as she is very strong willed and may be unbiased.</p>

	<h3>Top Campaign Platform</h3>
	<p>In Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse, Barbie’s “presidential platform” would revolve around positivity, empowerment, and fun, with a focus on creativity and inclusion. A popular quote would be like: “Dream Big for Everyone!” Her top platforms to campaign would be her reputation as her reputation speaks for itself but also different media channels.</p>
