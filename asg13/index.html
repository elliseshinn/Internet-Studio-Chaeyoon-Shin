  <h1>Assignment 13</h1>
  <p>I’m really interested in jobs that let me combine creativity with problem-solving, especially in UX/UI or game design. I enjoy figuring out how people interact with apps or games and finding ways to make those experiences smoother, more intuitive, and more visually appealing. I want a role where I can work on layouts, user flows, prototypes, and design systems, while still having room to experiment and learn. Being part of a team that turns ideas into real, usable products really motivates me. Ideally, I want a job where I can grow my design skills and help create meaningful user experiences.</p>

        <p>Job Title: UI/UX Designer (Mid-Level)</p>
        <p>This role stands out to me because it focuses on improving real user experiences across different software tools. I like that the job mixes creative design with hands-on collaboration between developers, QA, and marketing. It seems like a place where I could grow my skills by working on actual products used by real companies. The description mentions “thinking outside the box,” which fits the kind of creative problem-solving I enjoy. Plus, it’s a mid-level position, so it feels challenging but still reachable as I build my portfolio.</p>

        <p>Job Title: Product UI Designer - AI Trainer</p>
        <p>I think this UX Designer position would be a great fit for me because it lines up with the kind of work I genuinely enjoy—creating interfaces that feel natural, clean, and easy for people to use. I like figuring out how users think and then shaping designs that match those needs, so a role focused on UX research, wireframing, and prototyping feels like the right direction for me. The job also gives me a chance to grow my skills in problem-solving and visual design while working on real products that people interact with every day. On top of that, collaborating with developers and other designers is something I’m excited about, because I love the creative process of building something as a team. Overall, it feels like a role where I can contribute creatively, learn a lot, and keep moving toward the kind of design career I want.</p>

        <p>Even though it’s a senior role, I like how much this job focuses on user flows, mockups, and design systems — all things I’m passionate about. The company builds tools for employee engagement, which means the designs actually affect how organizations connect with their people. I find that kind of purpose motivating. This job also includes a lot of collaboration with product and engineering teams, which is the type of environment I’d like to work in. Being able to shape the direction of the user experience sounds exciting and would push me to keep improving my design skills.</p>
