      <h2>Design Statement</h2>
      <img src="./images/italian.jpeg" style="float: right; width:150px; height:100px; border: solid black 1px;">
      <p style="align-items: center; margin: 60px; font-size:1.5em; background-color: #B9E9F0;">
        I chose the two fonts because they felt right for the movie. One is simple and easy to read which makes the main text comfortable to look at and the other has a little flair that matches the movie's style and personality. I also thought about where the text sits and how big it should be so the page does not feel cluttered or empty. Headings stand out just enough and the smaller text is easy to follow. I wanted the page to feel like it belongs in the same world as the movie.
<br><br> The colors and images are inspired by the movie as well. I picked shades that match its mood and vibe and used images that make you feel like you are stepping into it. Buttons are cute but clear and placed where people would naturally want to click. I wanted all the elements from fonts to colors to images to feel like they are part of the movie's story while still being easy and fun to use. The goal was for the page to feel like it fits perfectly with the movie.
