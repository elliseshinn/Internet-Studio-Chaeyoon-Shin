	<p>Mitsuha Miyamizu is the female protagonist of Makoto Shinkai’s 2016 anime film Your Name (Kimi no Na wa). She is a high school girl living in the rural town of Itomori, where she helps her grandmother and younger sister with their family’s Shinto shrine duties. Longing to escape her small-town life, Mitsuha wishes to experience the excitement of Tokyo. Her life changes dramatically when she mysteriously begins switching bodies with a boy named Taki Tachibana, a student living in the city. Through their shared experiences, Mitsuha and Taki form a deep emotional bond that transcends time and space, ultimately driving the story’s themes of connection, fate, and longing.</p>
