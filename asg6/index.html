	<h1>Assignment 6: Six Thinking Hats</h1>
<img src="./images/red-hat.png" style="float:right; margin-right:20px;"> <p>My <em>dominant</em> thinking method is the Red hat which is intuition, feelings and emotions, allowing the thinker to putforward an intuition without any need to justify it. Usually these feelings and intuition are canonly introduced into a discussion if they are supported by logic!</p>
</div>

<h2>White Hat</h2>
<p>For the White Hat, we discussed that while the current idea includes subsections and a form for people to leave advice, it needs to be broken down further and made more specific as there are some missing elements, such as information on scholarships and finances. We also talked about making the project less general by labeling exactly what content will be posted and what type of advice students will find most useful. To gather accurate and relevant information, we talked about using social media platforms like Reddit for student surveying.</p>

<h2>Red Hat</h2>
<p>She felt that the idea of having older students provide advice and share experiences with newer students is both meaningful and the most appealing part of the website. They talked about how this resource would have been extremely helpful when they themselves were freshmen. I was suggested to that this project could become a valuable support system, easing the transition for first-year students while allowing people to develop a sense of community within the student body.</p>

<h2>Black Hat</h2>
<p>One major concern was managing who is allowed to comment and ensuring accountability through user login systems. We talked about how moderation will be necessary to maintain the quality and safety of the content, which could require hiring or assigning people to supervise the discussions threads.</p>

<h2>Yellow Hat</h2>
<p>The comment and advice section was viewed as a helpful feature that could double the engagement and make the platform useful for students seeking guidance. One suggestion I was given was to add a label under a student's username to show what university they were a part of or currently is. Overall, she believed that having multiple student perspectives would make it a valuable and appealing resource for all users, especially that of freshmen.</p>

<h2>Green Hat</h2>
<p>She was telling me that while the project could initially target freshmen, it could easily expand to include other groups, such as sophomores or even transfer students, allowing more inclusivity and increasing its usefulness. They also considered social media as both an alternative platform and a potential promotional tool for increasing engagement.</p>

<h2>Blue Hat</h2>
<p>The main subject we talked about was how the website can best provide advice for freshmen through a user-friendly, accessible platform. I talke about how my goal is to help as many students as possible by creating a well-structured, easy-to-navigate interface. To maintain focus and keep discussions relevant, they proposed implementing moderators and using tags to categorize posts. The conclusion was that the project should continue to emphasize clarity as well as meaningful engagement between students.</p>

<h3>Project Conclusion and Changes</h3>
<p>As a result of this discussion, I decided to make the following change to my project: Rather than just making it a general advice platform, I want to make it into a more structured, student-centered resource emphasizing reliability and inclusivity. I will expand beyond just freshmen as the target audience and include other student levels, recognizing that everyone could benefit from shared experiences. New features such as verified logins, moderators, and user tags will ensure safety and organization. Additionally, more categories for advices such as for finance and academics would also be added and gives more depth and practical value to the overall website.</p>
