	<h1>Assignment 12</h1>
	<p>I think I like all these movies because they pull me into worlds that feel magical and exciting while still giving me characters I can connect with. They all have something a little weird or emotional or funny that sticks with me. Some of them make me feel cozy and dreamy like Spirited Away or Your Name. Some feel quirky and dark like Coraline or Corpse Bride. Others make me think about growing up or figuring out who I am like Barbie, A Silent Voice, or 10 Things I Hate About You. Even the more adventurous ones like Suzume or Harry Potter make me feel like I’m stepping into another life for a while</p>
