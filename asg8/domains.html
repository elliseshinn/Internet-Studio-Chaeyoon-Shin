	<p>I did not get to talk with my classmate about my three domain name ideas but I got to ask some of my other friends for which one sounded best for a site that gives college freshmen advice. We both agreed that a good name should be easy to remember and actually sound like something students would want to visit. My friend really liked FreshieForums.com the most because it sounds like a cool place for new students to hang out online, share experiences, and get tips about college life. <br><br> After talking it over, I decided that FreshForum.com is my favorite too. It’s short, catchy, and fits perfectly with what my website is about. I like that it gives off a friendly vibe and feels like a real community for freshmen who are just starting out. It’s simple but still has meaning, which makes it the best choice for my project.</p>
